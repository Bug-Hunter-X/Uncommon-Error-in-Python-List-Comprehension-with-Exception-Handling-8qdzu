This repository contains examples of uncommon errors in Python code, specifically focusing on a list comprehension that does not handle all potential exceptions gracefully.  The `bug.py` file demonstrates the issue, while `bugSolution.py` provides a more robust solution.

The primary issue is that the initial try/except block doesn't catch all cases where the list comprehension could fail (i.e., when the list element is not a dictionary or does not contain the key 'value').  Additionally, a check for NoneType objects in the input list is missing.

The solution improves exception handling by adding more comprehensive checks and handling of different exception types.
